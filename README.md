# FYP-Medical-Image-Segmentation-using-U-Net-Architecture
Dive into the future of medical image analysis with our GitHub repo! Discover the U-Net++ architecture's potential for precise and efficient FYP-Medical Image Segmentation
Welcome to the **FYP-Medical Image Segmentation using U-Net++ Architecture** repository!

## About

This repository contains the code and resources for our final year project (FYP) focusing on advanced medical image segmentation. We explore the potential of the U-Net++ architecture to achieve precise and efficient segmentation of complex medical images.
This repository contains the code for an image segmentation model based on **UNet++**: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation implemented in PyTorch. The architecture's details can be found in the [original UNet++ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165).

## Key Features

- **U-Net++ Architecture**: We leverage the power of U-Net++ for improved segmentation accuracy.
- **Cutting-Edge Techniques**: Incorporating state-of-the-art deep learning methods for medical image analysis.
- **Collaboration**: Join us in enhancing medical diagnostics and treatment through innovative segmentation solutions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FYP-Medical-Image-Segmentation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the codebase and documentation to understand our approach.
